You will get distortion looking straight on. The monitor was poorly calibrated with WAY too much gamma, luckily adjusting this with Windows is trivial, I will get back to \'S Mode\' later on. You will not be able to use this monitor for watching movies with a lot of dark scenes. If you are looking at the screen dead on the outer regions of black will be distorted to LIGHT grey.The keyboard is decent, the 10-key is a bit difficult with the keys not being the right size on the side. The button press is tactile and usable and the feel is fine enough for typing blind, which you shouldn\'t have to do since the keyboard is back-lit.The touch pad is okay, it\'s actually a bit too sensitive, the lower corners can be used as buttons but I would greatly prefer physical buttons like on the current Lenovo brand laptops. The touch pad has a fingerprint reader in the top right corner which interferes with the operation of the touch pad but at least the fingerprint reader is fast!The speakers are complete garbage, they have no semblance to actual sounds and it sounds like you are listening to a cellphone speaker through a wooden door. They are completely unusable for anything at all, do not buy this laptop if you enjoy playing anything on your speakers.The webcam is usable, but it\'s nothing to write home about, capping out at 720p/30fps it will feel like a power-point presentation more than a video feed on any video chat. The sound is about the same as phone quality. If you do video chats frequently, find another laptop.Back to windows and \'S Mode\'. Windows is pre-installed, it had some of the latest updates already so it was recently installed. It doesn\'t have much bloatware, but having Skype installed is too much already. The \"type\" of Windows that is installed is called \'S Mode\' which is basically a locked down completely restrictive version of Windows. You can\'t even download Chrome from the web you have to get it from the Microsoft store - Chrome being the first app I install on any Windows computer -. I removed \'S Mode\' almost immediately.The laptop has 4Gb of non-removable memory and 4Gb of replaceable memory which is nice even though it\'s only single channel.The laptop is made from a plastic frame which I actually don\'t mind, it makes the laptop reasonably light, but it gives it a cheap experience. Opening the lid for example requires two hands or a technique, both of which is actually mildly inconvenient.Summary:The good: Decent keyboard and touch pad, fast loading web pagesIf you like a want a PC for viewing Netflix/media at home with no headphones, look somewhere else. If you want a PC for viewing Wikipedia/news then this will be decent but there are cheaper laptops that can do that better. If you have a fancy IPS monitor, you will hate this laptop. If you are even thinking about gaming, the answer is no.Seeing as this laptop has such limited uses with the horrible screen and speakers, I cannot give this laptop a better review that 3 stars. It\'s only purpose is to view webpages and basic coffee-shop work.\n\n','negative','subjective',1,1,'2020-07-30 19:24:48.977738'),(2,1,'AFVVQZGK5NXTY6MEBQVG6WEDVNCQ','Javier Contreras','the United States','February 20, 2020',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVVQZGK5NXTY6MEBQVG6WEDVNCQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  With respect to the aspect everything is perfect for the cost, the only problem is that I wanted to check the memory and it turns out that it came with a 4GB and the description says of 8GB I am disappointed in this.  since one trusts what they are selling.

My criteria were: lightweight, 8gb RAM, 64gb+ SSD, 1080p, with a full-sized HDMI port (no mini), Windows OS. I wanted it mostly for web browsing, word processing, and some fairly light gaming (modded Minecraft, Java version). After about a month, I am so far satisfied with this computer for all of those tasks.In fact, it surpassed my expectations in regards to gaming. I expected that it would be incapable of running more than a couple of mods, but so far it\'s taken everything I\'ve thrown at it. I have not overclocked the processor (intentionally, anyway - perhaps windows does it automatically now?), and as such am operating at the stock 2.3Ghz (I think).I was slightly worried about purchasing this due to the reviews that commented about the screen quality/viewing angles. However, I am happy to report that I have not had any issues with screen visibility or warped edges. Perhaps I am simply plebian in my tastes, but it looks fine to me.It came with Windows 10 S, which I certainly did not want, but it was perfectly easy to disable.The backlit keyboard is honestly a lifesaver. I hadn\'t specifically sought out this feature, but it\'s fantastic. It comes with various brightnesses instead of a toggle, which frankly is unnecessary because the lowest setting is plenty bright. However, as mentioned in other reviews, it does cause a significant hit to battery life (or so it seems).The battery life is my only quibble, but admittedly, I believe that\'s mostly due to my usage rather than the machine itself. I have multiple Chrome tabs running at all times, as well as Visual Studio Code, and frequently Minecraft as well. At this level of usage, the battery lasts on average 2-3 hours. I haven\'t timed it though, so that is simply an estimate on my part.All in all, I am much happier with this $300 laptop than I was with my old laptop, which 8 years ago was twice the price. No doubt you can find better performance with a higher budget, but if you are tight on money, I highly recommend this device.\n\n','neutral','subjective',0.358,1,'2020-07-30 19:24:49.004766'),(6,1,'AFES4QMHC2XWW4S7KPVLBQ7GVRBA','Electric imaging equipment designer.','the United States','June 18, 2020',2,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFES4QMHC2XWW4S7KPVLBQ7GVRBA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  ¬†I was angry of seeing this kind of fake like screen.

I fell in love with it.  When the project ended, I had to turn it back in to the company.  So went to Amazon and found my baby.  I brought it.With the SSD drive, it boots up like an iPad.  For all these years I would complain about Windows being slow.  But now see it was the hardware.  Next, it is so light.  I love just carrying it from my desk to a meeting to take notes or minutes.Light weight and super fast and thin.  I only got the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB drive. Would have liked the 16 GB RAM and bigger drive but wanted to keep the price down. you can go crazy with add ons. After all I have 5 other PC\'s at home already (3 Apple & 2 Windows).Now for the semi bad part. I got the LG Gram laptop all set up with Office, Outlook, OneDrive, my special software loaded etc.. and noticed some web pages were slow to down load.  Checked my speed and it was bad.  I got .6 mbps download and 12 mbps upload.  Yes, that is correct the download was poor. barely moving.  I checked all drivers were up to date. I rebooted my modem, router, changed networks, compared with my other PC\'s and they all were fine.  175 to 280 mpbs download.  All signs to me was the hardware was defective.  I had only had the new laptop for 2 days. I was ready to return it. !!!A friend came over, I complained to him. He suggested it was a driver problem.  I showed him all drivers were up to date. Then he noticed the wifi adapter was made by Intel (wifi 9560) BUT the driver was from Microsoft.  He said lets see if Intel has a driver.  Sure enough they did. we installed it and the problem was fixed.Wow, I was so relieved.  I really did not want to send it back. I loved it.

So, I can compare this with Acer.Pros:1. Battery life: Around 10 hours of keeping play videos like watching movies or intensive work. Normal document work on and off can last  around 17 hours. Idling with display on may last for 28 hours. (new update: keep working on MS office and it lasts around 10 hours.)2. Super light weight and big screen of course. ( I also got a rechargeable blue tooth mouse to save a USB port.)3. Micro SD card slot: I love it. Acer swift 5 uses SD card with half of the card exposed outside, making it easy to bend. This LG used micro SD and most of the card in the laptop. I now used 512GB micro SD card as the drive. I can bring the card away with me for the important data.4. Read/Write speed up to 87 MB/s for big file transfer among SSD, micro SD, and USB3.0 card reader. The card reader was tested around 100MB/s on Acer swift 5.5. easy to setup with rechargeable bluetooth mouse.6. support up to 2TB micro SD card for future expansion.7. 3x USB3.0 + 1x type C USB3.0 are powerful enough to drive those WD and Seagate derive at the same time. I am not sure about USB3.1. However, I have 4 of them connected and only transferring data with 2 HDD drives.Cons:1. Response a little bit slower than Acer swift 5. But still can take it. (I turned down real-time security things. Anyway, I usually behind a gateway firewall)2. Audio effect is not good without earphone, much worse than Acer swift 5. High pitch sounds like locked inside the computer. This is basically not for entertainment. Earphone or external speakers are recommended. The win 10 even has no equalizer for me to fix sound effects.3. A little bit glare of video playback, not top quality, worst than Acer swift 5.4. If fan is triggered on, it generates more heat and it seems getting into dead loop of keep cooling down. It ends up with making it shorter battery time. Dimming the screen is a better option so that the PC stay longer for 1 full charge and avoiding fan triggered.Conclusion: This is very good for business travel and documentation work, not recommended for gaming or entertainment.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.58,1,'2020-07-30 19:24:52.424687'),(9,2,'AFIVDM4APKFE4Z3EMPZY2CNTEO7A','A.J.','the United States','October 8, 2019',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIVDM4APKFE4Z3EMPZY2CNTEO7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Edit edit - Screen in the last 2 weeks has developed excessive play, to where simply typing or using the track pad causes the screen to annoyingly wobble back and forth.

I originally was considering more expensive options, but I had tried his Chromebook for a couple hours (writing a paper using it) and I liked it too. I ordered a new one, and upon receiving it I plugged it into the charger for its first charge. The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement.The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen. I ended up returning this one as well and choosing a more expensive laptop from a different company as I planned originally. My friend\'s Acer Chromebook R11 works fine and he has had it about 6 months. He was surprised that I had these troubles.I\'m not sure what the quality control process is.

(Most developers are.) For years I ran Windows with a Linux VM or Linux with a Windows VM, and was able to have both worlds I wanted/needed - though with more than a little effort to bridge the VM host and guest environments. Then Apple moved Mac OS to Darwin, which provides a full Unix underneath - heaven. But expensive, and with Apples built-in limits - few ports, no touchscreens, and increasingly not expansible. Then Chromebooks offer Linux within a simple, fairly elegant UI environment. And then - crucial, for me - Microsoft offers WSL 2, with Linux integration for developers. (I expect that both Google and Microsoft are doing this in good part for their internal developer ecosystems, as well as to provide for external developers.) So we developers (who are also consumers) get the benefits of commodity competition - like this terrific LG model.It has everything except good speakers.The most compelling thing for me is probably the 14\" screen on a 2.5 lb device.

On top of that, the expansibility - there\'s an addition PCIe / NVME disk slot, extensible RAM, even an SD slot - and lots of ports, and I can\'t imagine a better choice for a high-capability yet also lightweight device.In the month I\'ve had it, it has lived up to my (high) expectations. Windows still has a lot of ragged edges (but you can tweak it to do whatever you need), and the speakers are tinny, at best.

I got my laptop a few days ago and used it for one day before having the touchpad give up on me (no my rating on this product will not be affected because i received a defect), I followed the steps on their website to fix this to no avail because they didn‚Äôt have the proper hardware updates on their site for this laptop as you can see in their description of the product on the amazon listing page some of the info is wrong. That being said this laptop is pretty decent and I do recommend it for college students and business workers it‚Äôs light and very portable, I can hold this with one hand effortlessly the only thing i dislike about the build is the plastic shell, but when you get specs like the AMD RYZEN 5 3500u with Vega 8 graphics and a 256 gb SSD for this price you cant really complain.More about gaming: I‚Äôve tested games like Warface, Fortnite, and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 they played well on low settings this pc isn‚Äôt bad for that what it wont run that well will be games like call of duty modern warfare, but i‚Äôm sure with overclocking and enabling parked cores even that can be played. The screen of the laptop is 60hz so playing these games at 60fps looks smooth.Tips: If you plan on buying this laptop and you aren‚Äôt used to 14 inch screens beware it‚Äôs pretty hard to get used to but you will eventually.Summary: This is a good laptop for work and school it‚Äôs pretty powerful and it‚Äôs also good for light gaming I recommend it.Note to Lenovo: Support this product give it touchpad driver updates or Im afraid more people will run into the same problem as me and have to return the product because you aren‚Äôt supporting it well enough, I can barely find info or videos on this model at all, but I may consider making one if I do decide to get this model again after I return the defect I received.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.773,1,'2020-07-30 19:25:59.486277'),(27,19,'AHGNICASCCFT6K5VGZ2AYH6OMAQQ','Milton','the United States','May 13, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGNICASCCFT6K5VGZ2AYH6OMAQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  It\'s great and it\'s very reliable it charges so fast!and its amazing!\n\n','positive','subjective',1,1,'2020-07-30 19:25:59.493116'),(28,21,'AFTKVTVVRCUUY7ASSH4ULTBGY4ZQ','Dave and Kym','the United States','July 13, 2019',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTKVTVVRCUUY7ASSH4ULTBGY4ZQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Bought this unit as a budget replacement for my fairly high-powered Dell desktop which was lost during flooding. I wasn\'t expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected.Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box.I wasn\'t paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs.Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer.Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that\'s just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it.Pretty sure I\'m going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won\'t do complex graphics.Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I\'ve read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life.Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon.The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don\'t even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions.A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that \"it gets so hot\" or \"the fan sounds like a 747 taking off\": Just because it\'s called a laptop doesn\'t mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable.If it died tomorrow, I\'d buy another.Loving itUpdate 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close):\"Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!\"Did you hear that? I\'m a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I\'ll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I\'m OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer.Totally pleased.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.822,1,'2020-07-30 19:26:11.666057'),(29,21,'AGFUKNF6EAA5277QYX6ETYYTDNLA','ttview','the United States','June 28, 2019',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFUKNF6EAA5277QYX6ETYYTDNLA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  The fan noise on this laptop is so bad that when you first hear it you\'re going to think your next door neighboor is using a leaf blower outside. I DARE you to tell me i\'m wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There\'s more: If you\'re a long time user of acer products you\'ve become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here\'s the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you\'re used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you\'ll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you\'re only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the \"acer quick access application\" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won\'t solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port.Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can\'t even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I\'ll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you\'re a long time acer product user and you\'ve become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality.

I still very much love this laptop. Admittedly, the \"Bad\" list (below) might sound overly negative, but I\'m just being real. The laptop isn\'t perfect, but *for me* the pros still outweigh the cons and I\'d still buy this again in an instant. It\'s totally understandable if some of these things are deal-breakers for other people -- but if you still get the laptop, hopefully this review helps you understand what you\'re getting.Good:- Still love the large screen and light weight (doesn\'t feel bulky to me)- Still enjoy the keyboard layout and number pad- So far, no bends or dents. The lid hinge is still tight/stable.- Trackpad works well, feels good.- The screen and resolution are bright and crisp enough for me.Bad (although none of these are deal-breakers for me, some of them are annoying):- The included charger charges SOOOO slowly. The laptop takes hours to charge. Even going from 20% to say 70% takes forever -- it\'s only a little better if you shut it off/standby/hibernate first. This is my biggest complaint.- The WiFi takes forever to reconnect when resuming Windows from standby or hibernate. This is my second biggest complaint. It seems to happen on different WiFi networks and a none of my other laptops have had this problem on those same WiFi networks. I Googled a lot to try to fix this, but nothing worked -- including latest drivers. This is probably more of a Windows config/driver problem, but it\'s still happening on my laptop and I can\'t fix it.- Battery life isn\'t great. When studying I get maybe 5 hours before draining to 20ish%. Obviously this will be different for everyone because we all run different apps or have different things running in the background, but I\'m surprised it isn\'t better.- Speakers aren\'t very good. They\'re not super loud but not very clear either. Pretty disappointing. They sound like they vibrate/resonate when playing particular frequencies. The speakers aren\'t blown for sure, they just rattle in those very specific instances for some reason.- I\'ve resorted to only using hibernate when I close the laptop lid (versus just going into standby). The laptop doesn\'t seem to handle standby well and still runs for quite a while before actually going to standby (if at all). Sometimes I put the laptop in a fitted soft case and I later find out that Windows never really went on standby and I now have a dead battery or I find that the laptop is really hot from running while trapped in the case. Hibernate is fine and it\'s not slow, but it\'s annoying that standby doesn\'t work like it does for other laptops. Probably a Windows issue if anything, but I couldn\'t find any fixes for this -- and I\'ve tried a lot.- I wish the track pad was centered relative to the keyboard\'s home row and space bar, i.e. a little bit more to the left.- The CPU has throttled down to 0.4 GHz (400 MHz) on occasion. Not a lot though. I wasn\'t doing anything intensive. Maybe Windows was indexing? Generally, doesn\'t seem to thermal throttle much though.=====ORIGINAL REVIEW February 4, 2020:I decided I wanted a lightweight, large screen laptop so the LG Gram 17 was really the only option -- other light laptops aren\'t 17\", and other 17\" laptops aren\'t lightweight. Because of this I admit that this laptop is on the pricey side, but that\'s to be expected if there are no direct competitors. I\'ve been waiting for the 10th Gen Intel processor. It runs at a lower clock speed than the previous 8th Gen processor, but according to benchmarks it\'s faster and has better power efficiency. The 10 nm vs the 8th Gen 14 nm manufacturing helps. I haven\'t had this long enough yet to comment on everyday use, but I\'ll tell you my first impressions.Similar to the previous model, it\'s lightweight with a large screen. The CPU isn\'t super fast, but that wasn\'t what was important to me. I wanted long battery life and a large screen. I\'m a student so both of these benefit me more than a super-fast processor. The processor is fast enough for what I need it for. A lot of YouTube reviewers don\'t like this laptop because they think the CPU is under-powered -- they think the only people who want 17\" screens are content creators like them, but they\'re not understanding the audience that actually appreciate what this laptop has to offer. My previous laptop had a 4k 15\" touchscreen. I\'ll have to say that I thought I\'d use those options more than I really did. I appreciate that this laptop has a lower resolution (but still high enough to be crisp) to help with battery life. Also, I didn\'t find the touchscreen useful at all so I\'m glad this doesn\'t have it.Some of the things I\'ve read from the previous year\'s model is that the laptop would consume more power than it could charge when under load (maybe high CPU-intensive tasks? or charging a phone on USB?). So essentially people would say that their battery would drain even while charging, which I think is pretty bad. Hopefully the power-efficiency of the new CPU will help with that, but I don\'t know if that\'s still a problem. Also, people said that the CPU would thermal throttle with the 8th Gen Intel. Again, not sure yet if this model will do that, but I\'m hoping that the lower clock speed and the better efficiency of the 10th Gen will alleviate that. Also, an LG spokesperson somewhere said that this laptop has \"better cooling\" than the previous gen. I don\'t know if that\'s true, but if it is, hopefully that helps as well.Here are my other first impressions. The keyboard keys are quiet but a little mushy. Not the best, but it\'s good enough. Also, the new keyboard layout with the expanded backspace and enter keys and the four-column number pad seem better than the previous model. When I first typed on the keyboard, I, like a lot of other reviewers, wasn\'t used to shifting my typing to the left of the screen, but I\'m confident that I\'ll get used to it. I don\'t use the number pad a lot, but on my desktop I do use it from time to time, so I think the laptop having it isn\'t a con. Having the proper number pad layout was important to me though because I type by muscle memory and am really fast with the number pad when I need it. The screen is bright enough. I don\'t like how glossy it is, but this is easily fixable. All my previous laptops had glossy screens and I always covered it up with anti-glare screen protectors. If you can install them correctly, then it\'s just as good as having an OEM anti-glare screen. People who complain about glossy screens don\'t usually know that they can correct the issue pretty easily. The trackpad works really well. It\'s smooth and has a good texture and feels similar to a Macbook Pro which is a good thing. The clickiness of it though is a bit mushy and soft (meaning the travel to push down on the trackpad to click isn\'t super-deep and it doesn\'t have a terribly satisfying click to it), but it\'s adequate and not horrible. I think it\'s fine. The fingerprint reader worked well, just as good as other laptops I\'ve had. One thing I don\'t like is that it has Windows 10 Home instead of Pro. Personally I use Bitlocker and would have preferred Pro for this. I may upgrade, but it\'s an extra cost.Spec-wise, here are some things that I noticed that some people might find useful. The memory is faster than the previous model\'s. It runs at 3200 MHz instead of 2400 MHz (see screenshot). The CPU base clock speed is slower (1.3 GHz vs 1.8 GHz) and the turbo is slower (3.9 GHz vs 4.6 GHz), but according to benchmarks if the 10th Gen has better processing power, better efficiency, runs cooler, and contributes to longer battery life, then I think this is a win. People would say that the 8th Gen would thermal throttle so getting the max turbo wasn\'t attainable anyway, so hopefully the new CPU will fix this. One thing I didn\'t like was that they include two 512 GB M.2 SSDs. Why not just one 1 TB? I saw that another store has the same LG model but with only one 512 GB for $350 cheaper. Looking back on it, I should\'ve bought that and use the difference to upgrade to one 1 TB or 2 TB SSD and sell the 512 GB. I was really hoping they would have at least set up the two SSDs in a RAID 0 configuration so I could have one logical 1 TB drive, but they don\'t. I included a screenshot of the SSDs that are included (Samsung MZVLB512HAJQ, M.2, 3000 MB/s seq. read, 270K IOPS ran. read, PRIe Gen 3 x4, 1800 MB/s seq. write, 420K IOPS ran. write -- according to Samsung\'s web site). I also included the TPM information that\'s listed in the BIOS. Again, because Bitlocker is important to me, I was interested in the TPM. My family\'s phones and WiFi router all use WiFi 6 (802.11ax) so I\'m glad this laptop has it to take advantage of my home network\'s infrastructure. I can confirm that this laptop also supports the new WPA3 which my router and phones are also using.The things included with the laptop are just the tiny power brick and an Ethernet to USB-C adapter. I love how small and light the power brick is, but I guess we\'ll have to see if it\'s under-powered. I\'ve also read that you can charge this laptop using USB-C power delivery. I\'m not sure of the wattage it allows, but this is something that I\'d like to look into.So all in all, it\'s too soon for me to really give a long-term review, but I did want to give some information which isn\'t really shown anywhere else (LG\'s website, etc.). Yes, the laptop is pricey for what it is, but again, it\'s the only lightweight laptop that comes in 17\". LG probably won\'t lower the price until there\'s more competition in this area, so the high price is expected. Also, this is a niche product. Only certain people want the big screen, the light weight, and moderate processing power. All-in-all I\'m happy with my purchase so far. I really do appreciate the better keyboard layout. A non-standard keyboard layout (3-column number pad) is a deal breaker for me, which is why I waited for this version of the laptop rather than getting the previous version.\n\n','positive','subjective',0.972,1,'2020-07-31 00:40:07.167402'),(40,52,'AEFKWEDTYTYHDIRQEDOBTOTIKU3Q','Pegasus','the United States','November 28, 2019',4,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFKWEDTYTYHDIRQEDOBTOTIKU3Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  This is not a gaming laptop and that is why I bought it. My old laptop a dell precision is getting tire and is too much for me to carry with my bad back. The power brick for it alone weighs more than the shipping weight of this laptop. Really it is lighter than my ipad. I saw the Gram on Linus Tech Tips and knew it was what I was looking for. It is the only one that had everything I need and nothing I don\'t. I don\'t play games or any heavy graphics so I don\'t need expensive power hungry gpu and other gaming features but I do need a 17\" high res screen, full size backlit keyboard, ports that don\'t need dongles, a fast cpu, a lot of ram and fast storage in the smallest most rugged package I can get and this is the only one that met my all those needs. I tried speccing laptops from all the major brands and any that came close were twice the price. I am very happy. Business users like me that need the power and portability without resorting to a gaming rig or a mobile workstation and the gram is the only one I have found meeting that need. It feels nice, looks nice, for having no vents it barely gets warm under a heavy load. Only points I would subtract is no hardware raid options for the drives but a little playing around in disk management I got it close to what I want.Edit: After 5 months I have to be honest and take a star off. The trackpad uses the generic windows 10 driver which leaves a bit to be desired. It also kind of flimsy and the left click sometimes sticks. Also the app I have open most of the time has burned into the screen. It is only noticeable if there is a dark background but it is there. These are minor annoyances overall and far from a deal breaker. It is otherwise very rugged and the battery life is great. I have actively used it on battery over 7 hours and still had 30% left. I found out it does have a cooling fan but it is so quiet you don\'t hear it and it vents out the back under the screen. Even under heavy load of multiple virtual machines it only gets warm to the touch and I have not noticed any throttling.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.674,1,'2020-07-31 00:40:07.173385'),(41,215,'AHAZTIPULA53RZQQVVXXJ644XCNA','K.

I put it on a food scale and it was the same weight as my ipad pro 12.9 with the keyboard cover - 2.5lbs.  You can\'t get any lighter than that for 15 inches!The gram doesn\'t feel cheap and it seems to have very good performance for regular tasks like Excel, Outlook and web surfing. I tend to open a LOT of windows and tabs at once and the gram handles it well. I love the glossy screen.I will say that the keyboard does take getting used to because the number pad makes the regular keys slightly off center and it takes me about 5 mins to adjust and not make multiple typing errors. I ended up missing the backspace key and hitting the \"-\" key several times because of the orientation.  It also changes the \"lapability\" because your hands are skewed to the left slightly. I\'m sure I will get used to it over time, but if I had a choice I would have preferred a wider keyboard and no dedicated number pad.I just got this four days ago, so I haven\'t had a great deal of time to assess the battery, but so far so good.  The finger print reader is great. I haven\'t had that before and am really enjoying the ease of it.  I love that they included a USB-C to Ethernet adapter in the box. I am also coming from an older Surface Pro 3, so having 3 USB ports feels like a luxury.I would definitely recommend this from a quality/performance perspective if you need a bigger screen without the weight, but I could imagine the keyboard might irritate some people. I love it and am very happy with the purchase.\n\n','neutral','subjective',0.493,1,'2020-07-31 00:40:30.526005'),(42,215,'AFBZ2LPKSDM6X4E7PP5VSILEQBIA','Erica','the United States','July 11, 2019',4,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFBZ2LPKSDM6X4E7PP5VSILEQBIA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Weight: This is delightfully lightweight. I can\'t actually carry it in two fingers like their description boasts, but not far off, and I did worry I\'d forgotten to pack it in my backpack the first day!The keyboard is only ok. I\'m very picky. It gives maybe a little too much resistance? (Though as I type this on an external keyboard it is very similar). For whatever reason, I am struggling just a little not to miss keystrokes. Hopefully I\'ll adapt soon. I love the number pad and I love that the default is to numbers (my other set up requires me to hit the Num Lock every single time I wake up the computer). \"Delete\" is a little small but fine. I wish the volume controls were dedicated buttons instead of requiring the Function key, but better to have it at all as a clear shortcut.The battery life is good, but I want more control. Past laptops have let me tinker with both performance and screen brightness independently in battery mode (perhaps this is just Windows 10 and I didn\'t notice on my other Win 10 laptops??). It also turned itself off at 10% left (what\'s the point of it being 10% and not 1% if I can\'t use it?). I will try to pay more attention to battery life but I don\'t think I\'m getting anywhere near 18.5 hours; maybe 9-10?Performance: I\'ve had it freeze or stutter a few times in everyday multitasking. It gets itself going again though. Nothing longer than about 3 sec. so far. Some things are quite snappy though. It has more hangups with the internet than with anything purely internal, so perhaps my internet connection is partly to blame, though that shouldn\'t cause things like the cursor to freeze.Screen: The full HD has proved a mixed blessing. Some things are beautifully clear...and others are more blurry and/or pixilated than ever before. This is my biggest problem so far as I am concerned about eye strain looking at blurry text documents. I\'ve discovered LibreOffice is reasonably crisp with its own .odt files but no longer when opening .docx files. And the icons are quite pixelated. Scrivener also had problems but their forum provided adequate fixes. MS Word is ok for text, but oddly some of their dialogue boxes are blurry. AeonTimeline2, however is absolutely gorgeous. And the text I\'m writing now straight on a webpage is nice and clear. In short, it is very uneven. I understand not all FHD laptops experience this problem, but many do; one commentor thought it might be some interaction of the Intel integrated graphics cards with high resolution for older apps who weren\'t written for FHD.Setup: took half a day (3-4 hours). Not the snappiest laptop I\'ve set up in the past year, given I\'ve done a few for work as well (two much cheaper than this one). Nothing was awful, there were just a lot of set up things to do initially, and downloads were not particularly fast (though programs installed within a few minutes once downloaded). But if you have a number of programs to download, don\'t expect this to be a 1 hour plug and play.Charging: the included charging cable is reasonably long and has a dedicated charging port. I am pleased that USB-C charging from battery packs is an available option but I will need a different cord and have not yet tried it.Fingerprint reader / Sign-in: a little creepy but fairly convenient. The fast startup when I use it is nice. I wish the PIN option remained open on the lock screen however. If there\'s a reason I didn\'t use the fingerprint reader to turn on the laptop then I want to be able to sign in...not need to open a menu and select the PIN pad and then have it open that, and only then get to enter my pin. In short, instead of a sign in that is always about 6 seconds, I sometimes get 1 second and other times 12 seconds.Make: the screen is a little bendy. It\'s simple; there\'s no flashiness at all.Summary: I wanted to love it, but I feel like I\'m slow to warm up given all the little hangups with blurriness, lag, some minor typing fatigue/missed keys and so on. However, for the long battery life and ultra lightweight for the screen size, I\'m going to do everything I can to make this work.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.951,1,'2020-07-31 00:40:30.532987'),(43,215,'AEVVFQ2MN7HUG6IBTW3XLBKG72CQ','Stuck on You','the United States','June 9, 2019',3,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVVFQ2MN7HUG6IBTW3XLBKG72CQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  This laptop is extremely light and but for a couple of problems would\'ve been a keeper.Pros:VERY light.

Need to use both hands to mute, unmute, turn volume up/down as there are no direct keys for them, have to press down Function key.

I chose this as something for my daughter to use during the coronavirus shutdown. Her dad didn\'t want her on his laptop, I didn\'t want her on my desktop, and the older Galaxy tablet she was using wasn\'t quite as functional with Google classroom. I got this because it was about $200. I was debating on getting another laptop or a newer tablet, I decided on a chromebook instead. If she really needs the full power of a personal computer, she can use my desktop. Actually, most things she can even do on the outdated Galaxy tablet I got in 2016. (The bad thing about Galaxy tablets, or any Android tablet actually, is that they don\'t get universal system updates... they\'ve actually stopped updating mine, and it\'s only running on Android 8). I figured I wouldn\'t have that problem with a chromebook. This is the most basics of chromebooks there is, and everything that it does is already listed in the product description. I really don\'t have anything to add to it on this review that the description hasn\'t already covered. I like this for what I needed. It\'s inexpensive compared to other brands, but it doesn\'t offer much. Another reason why I chose this was because HP is a reliable brand of computers and accessories... but, be informed of what you are purchasing. Don\'t buy this thinking you\'re going to be able to edit videos, play online games, and stream hours of Netflix... this is ideal for a student from grade school to high school (once they\'re in college, an inexpensive off-brand laptop would work better)... although, the newer tablets offers just about everything a chromebook offers, but is usually more expensive.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.681,1,'2020-07-31 00:40:52.966607'),(45,216,'AHJ2CBEHLKD7Y7ROCNBXDY6IXCBA','Jezz','the United States','April 1, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJ2CBEHLKD7Y7ROCNBXDY6IXCBA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Great product for school age kids especially during this distant learning experience\n\n','positive','objective',0.575,0.857,'2020-07-31 00:40:52.972593'),(46,216,'AGFDQNO4D7RRZJPIJROKHQ5BLZLA','Suzacky','the United States','May 25, 2020',4,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFDQNO4D7RRZJPIJROKHQ5BLZLA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Not a bad machine depending on your needs.

The laptops that meet these criteria from brands such as Lenovo, Apple etc.  are quite expensive. LG gram series, although lesser known than its rivals, caught my eyes. Even Lenovos that cost around around 1000 dollars compromise with display quality and Macbooks are underpowered in this range. Hence, LG gram offered a better practical value. The 14 inch model I purchased offers plenty in terms of battery performance and is lighter than most other ultrabooks. The display is excellent in terms of color accuracy and brightness which is no wonder for LG IPS panels. The keys have decent amount of travel and the trackpad is good. I also like the fact that it has plenty of ports (including HDMI) and kept both RAM and SSD modules upgradeable. The included SSD is not NVMe though, I believe if I replace it with one, the performance will improve. I wish they had another another USB C port and included a type C charger in the box. The single USB C port supports charging. A full size SD card slot and a thunderbolt port (Not supported in the core i5 version) would be welcome.I initially ordered it during thanksgiving. Unfortunately, that first one I received had a defect, the battery drained suspiciously when turned off. When I contacted the seller, they immediately sent me a replacement which was great.

I work behind my desk for a living and when I get home, 80% of the time you can find me on pc or console. I saw these glasses at their Dreamhack Atlanta booth and was curious to know if they would help my eye strain. I wished I remember who I talked too, she was incredible and informative, but she straight up said you\'re not going to notice a difference right away but if you\'re behind a screen for more than 40 hours a week you\'ll notice it. She was right. Since I\'ve been back from Dreamhack, my eyes were completely shot for the week until these came in the mail. I was skeptical at first, but the really do make a difference. Im able to knock out reports and stay focused on the screen for much longer now. At the end of the day, my eyes feel hydrated and I can keep them open. Buy a pair if you\'re eyes are strained or youre getting headaches. You wont regret it. I attached a picture showing how they handle fluorescent lights in my office.

Seriously. Eye strain is something I‚Äôve experienced after long days of work and game.  By the end of the night my eyes are exhausted, dry, and I‚Äôve frequently left the end of the night with headaches. After using the eyewear, I did see improvement on how I felt at the end of the night. Anything that can improve the longevity I am able to game and work effectively I will buy into. After using the glasses for a week straight, the biggest positive is how comfortable they are. I work in front of a computer display my entire day. 8 hours during a day job, another 6-8 as a gamer. I‚Äôve not worn glasses since I was a young kid, to say that I‚Äôm not used to wearing something on my face the whole day is an understatement.Pros:-Extremely comfortable.-High quality frames, not lame plastic.-Stands up to blue light test. Does prevent substantial amount of blue light from passing through lens.Cons:-Spring hinges on the arms of the glasses made it so the frames didn\'t hug my head as tightly as I would have liked. Still very happy with how comfortable these are however.I‚Äôd give it the thorough look if you‚Äôre in the technology field or find yourself just more than the average gamer. Stamp of approval.

I‚Äôve had them for the better part of a few weeks now, so I will give my take on them.First I‚Äôll start off by saying I have 20/20 vision and do not normally wear glasses. I am a graphic designer so I spend a good 40 hours a week in front of a screen. I also like to play video games, so that adds more screen time. As of now, I use them mainly for work. The first two days of wearing them took some time to adjust to having a pair of frames on my face for 8hr a day. After that, I got use to wearing them and they didn‚Äôt irritate me as much.During the short time that I have used them (just a few weeks) I have noticed my eyes are not as dry and irritated (if at all) after work. The blue light filter seems to be working in the way intended. I like this pair in that they do not have a yellow tint to them, like many other ‚Äúgaming‚Äù glasses I have seen. This helps when you are dealing with my line of work and need to have colors be spot on.They are very stylish in design and the hard case and protective sleeve that come with the glasses are an extra plus. I can carry them in my purse without worry of scratching and use them anywhere I need.The only downside I have to these is that they are a bit bigger on my face and tend to slide off my nose. The frame is one solid piece, so there is no way to adjust the nose part to stay. A smaller framed pair might help with that, but these only come in one size. For the price, I would have hoped they fit properly, but as they came from online and not a physical glasses store, that is harder to achieve.\n\n','neutral','subjective',0.454,1,'2020-07-31 00:44:53.329171'),(73,83,'AF54A6KJTX77BF2WDBJTFBJ2VKRQ','GUY','the United States','July 17, 2020',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF54A6KJTX77BF2WDBJTFBJ2VKRQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  After spending nearly $1000.00 for this laptop, hours on the phone, and days trying to apply the pages and pages of instructional fixes  sent by email from ASUS,  I called  Amazon  Tech Support, and after spending over an hour on the phone, including 30 minutes on hold while he tried to contact ASUS Tech Support, was told that he could not help me.

Unfortunately it didn\'t really work very well for very long, maybe two days. I almost immediately noticed that windows were getting minimized randomly.

I then noticed that I would get random \"touch\" detection in the lower right corner (Windows \"show desktop\" shortcut) which would minimize all open windows, and sometimes restore them a few seconds later.

Definitely worth the price for the package you are getting. Android 5.1 is kinda pointless, because it takes longer to boot than windows, and it doesn\'t do as much, so besides the fact of \"oh im a tablet, now im a computer, now im a tablet computer!\", it\'s pointless. Hard drive space is slim, but manageable( if android was removed it would be a lot better). USE CHARGEING CABLE PROVIDED!!! The cable it comes with has a weird brick and is only 1ft long, but if you try to use a different, longer usb cable, it will die and have to completely recharge before it will turn back on. Let it die(ie. drain the battery) when you first get it and then fully recharge before using. Other than storage(which is expandable internally and externally via usb) and the finicky battery, this product is great. Awesome hardware and very well made. The track pad/ keyboard is a little touchy sometimes and will randomly minimize your window with no warning. TO USE THIS PRODUCT WITH NO ISSUE I recommend a wireless mouse, external hard drive, and maybe and extension cord for the dinky little charger provided.

Overall I\'m VERY impressed!  I upgraded it with a 2tb Seagate Firecuda SSHD and it\'s just the laptop of my dreams.  Besides the glitches with windows (no fault of Asus) it\'s perfect!  I wish I would\'ve waited just a bit longer for the RTX Supers for mobile to be released, but I\'m so happy with this purchase anyway.  I still would\'ve chosen Asus.Thermals:The fans are appropriately loud for the power that you get.  The cooling solution is very good!  I\'m incredibly impressed by the fact that it doesn\'t get hot to the touch, just warm!  Where you sit your palm stays cold!My MSI Ge62 Apache Pro 2qf had horrible thermals despite also having two fans.  This laptop does have one additional radiator, and the 2070 is more efficient than the 970m though, so that plays into the incredibly good thermal dissipation.Sturdiness:It feels premium, that sums it up.  You get what you pay for with Asus.  A $2k laptop should feel the part, and it really does!  The RGB sorta shows it too!  If you\'re a shower, this pretty much presents itself!  When you open it up, the textured aluminum deck will impress you.  That isn\'t painted or dipped, it\'s actually textured to achieve the carbon fiber look!  It\'s the little things that are getting me on this thing, as all the important things are pretty much as close to perfect as something like this could come.Sound:For a laptop of this size, sound is top notch!  Bass is incredible and It\'s hard to believe it comes out of such a small body.Display:This 240Hz IPS panel is just amazing!  It looks higher res than 1080p to me and I\'m not sure why.  I\'m coming from a TN 60Hz panel, so maybe that\'s it?  Anyway, color reproduion is great and results in a beautiful visual presentation.  The fluid motion of everything thanks to the 240Hz refresh rate is just eye candy.  Personally, I see the difference.I have also proven that this panel is truely refreshing as 240Hz.  TestUFO.com will be able to show you the difference between 60, 120, and 240 Hz.  While it doesn\'t stick out, 240Hz is noticeably better here.The only negative of this panel is the max display brightness.  It\'s a little bit hard to see in the daylight, but who will be taking their laptop outside in the middle of the day?Issues:This only issue I\'ve had are either petty, or not Asus\'s fault.-  The keystone keychain holder was torn a bit (not important at all for me)-  Updating the KB firmware was a little janky.-  RGB software is also rather janky.  It works, but doesn\'t feel \"complete.\"UPDATE (6/23/2020):Unfortunately, there is only one USB host controller for all ports.  There is no internal host controller for non-user devices.  Everything is shared on one chip.  A three camera setup for the Oculus CV1 is very difficult to get working.  Usually, two cameras will default to USB 2.0 because of bandwidth issues.  It\'s a shame this wasn\'t taken into account, but overall it\'s still a good laptop.\n\n','positive','subjective',0.993,1,'2020-07-31 00:59:35.244259'),(104,250,'AF3EG3CC7JIQEVDU6B3VX2ULFQSA','Cuong Nguyen','the United States','July 16, 2019',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3EG3CC7JIQEVDU6B3VX2ULFQSA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  The specs on this laptop is amazing.

The \"bad\" (Just annoying to me) stuff that i could say about it is that the armoury crate is the most broken app here, it works.....when it wants, controlling RGB light is alright but if you\'re buying an asus accessorie with Aura Sync, well i just have to say \"good luck with that\" because you\'\'ll end up like me and just leaving the mouse be on its own whithout syncing it because 70% of the time it wont work, and the last \"bad thing\" would be the mouse pad, i mean, i use a mouse so i dont really care, but when im using the machine without a mouse hmmm you from time to time will enable the num pad, but i dont really mind, in 2 days of use i believe i\'ve turn it on by accident like 6 times.In conclusion if you like asus and if u like gaming well buy this, it looks great, and it performs like a dime.....PS: the fans are loud but not that loud, if you\'ve been living in silence well it could bother you but if you live in constant noise in your work or house you wont mind like me when youre used to general noise, the fans are like a lego jet or something xD\n\n','negative','subjective',0.412,1,'2020-07-31 00:59:35.255229'),(106,182,'AFQZFVDEPM3ARDOOWVM6AMJ5UMAA','kanuhobrewer','the United States','January 23, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQZFVDEPM3ARDOOWVM6AMJ5UMAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  I went for this computer because it has an i3 processor, an SSD drive, a 15.6\" screen, comes in a beautiful darker blue color and from what I read from other reviewers, the SSD drive and RAM are both upgradeable. For $280 this is well worth the value.It\'s lightning fast, have no problem connecting to WIFI or bluetooth. The keyboard stretches from both ends, making it larger than a lot of keyboards on laptops this size as others also fit the speakers on both ends then the keyboard in between, and the keys are quiet, responsive and nicely saved.It does come in S-Mode but you can easily switch it to Windows 10 Mode. This is the first thing I did. Right after I tried watching YouTube videos to see how video streaming went and it was awful. Anytime something even just a bit fast happened, it would blur or jump frame rates. As it turns out though the fix was checking for any Windows Update and there was plenty.It took about 30 minutes altogether to update the laptop. After you check for updates, you\'ll have to restart your computer. Then, you\'ll need to check for updates again and restart your computer, again. Then do this one more time and check for updates. After your third time having to restart you shouldn\'t have any more updates. After I did this, I tried watching YouTube videos again and everything was smooth and perfect.I mainly use it for typing, browsing the Internet (have had so far up to 10 tabs open at once) and occasionally watching YouTube and Netflix. I also downloaded League of Legends and it definitely plays it well. I haven\'t made any upgrades to it yet, just because there hasn\'t been any need to but if there is eventually a need to, it\'s nice to know I will be able to and not have to buy another laptop, producing more waste and costing more money.I actually have 0 complaints.

The top case is still made of plastic, but it feels like a sturdy, durable plastic. The lid of the laptop is actually made out of metal and feels extremely durable. The trackpad on the laptop is actually usable and supports multi-gesture functions. If you\'re coming from a MacBook, you will feel right at home--it\'s not as a good as a MacBook trackpad (those are still king) but this one works very well.The performance of this laptop also blew me away. In real-world tests I would say that this is about as powerful as my 2015 MacBook Pro (they have similar hardware components). It handles Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro like a champ.My absolute favorite thing about this laptop though, is that it has TWO internal drive bays: an m.2 slot AND a 2.5-inch SATA port, so when I got this laptop I removed the included 128GB SSD, and put in my own 1TB m.2 SSD AND a 1TB 2.5-inch SSD. Also, while this laptop has RAM soldered to the board, it has a DDR4 expansion slot on the inside so you can expand the memory further. If you were to configure a MacBook Pro from Apple, this same configuration would cost you anywhere from $2500 to $3000!! With this laptop, I spent about $550 total with the SSDs and RAM I added.The only real downside of this laptop is the display. It\'s by no means a BAD display, it\'s extremely capable of doing regular work on, and it\'s very bright. But it\'s a lower-resolution display, so if you\'re doing like Photoshop work or something like that, it can feel a little cramped. The display also does not display colors very accurately, colors are very unsaturated, and it blue-shifts the colors too. So if you\'re doing important graphical work, this laptop screen is not that great, but for everyday tasks it will do just fine.The other downside is battery life, it\'s nowhere near as good as MacBook battery life, but it\'ll hold out for an hour or two without being plugged in.But yeah, if you just need a laptop for getting on the internet, Facebook, watching YouTube, this laptop is great. Far more capable than a tablet, it\'s got a nice big 15-inch display, has a keyboard, it\'s real fast, if you need more storage you can add it later. I would absolutely recommend this laptop for everyday folks.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.459,1,'2020-07-31 01:00:46.942819'),(108,182,'AEHI4M2GBJ5JDSZEOV7XGM4YQW7A','M','the United States','January 10, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEHI4M2GBJ5JDSZEOV7XGM4YQW7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  I bought this laptop for my girlfriend who doesn\'t need to do more than simple tasks.

Performance improvements across the board.  In the interim, I\'ve experimented with perhaps exceeding the DDR 2400 memory speed constraint, and despite a setting in the DDR4 sub menu under Device Settings (f12 on POST), memory speed does not exceed 1200 Mhz. Still it is worth it under Windows to increase to 16 or even 32 GB as most modern programs will consume as much memory as is available to them. Still, one last experiment before I declare the F12 menu a placebo: there\'s a setting to change M.2 port from SATA to SATA Express. So, will an NVMe drive work? I actually don\'t have one, but I do intend to at some point and will report success or failure. Finally, despite descriptions to the contrary, Intel AC 9260 WiFi card works just fine. Much better than the Qualcomm that comes standard.So,you may be asking, what is keeping this particular experience from the full 5 stars? I have had issues that, on one occasion, necessitated RMA to Dell (main board died). The fan is now getting quite loud and I do experience intermittent power issues related to wireless card (both the stock AND the Intel replacement) not being able to power on following wake from sleep and adapter warnings (well, it wouldn\'t be Dell without adapter warnings, now would it?)(Original review comments below)Please be aware before purchase AMD does NOT support Ryzen U processors-- directly. More specifically, you will not be able to install the latest Adrenaline driver suite available. That somewhat hampers this machine for media consumption (VLC player does not operate properly) or for light to moderate gaming (sub-optimal frame rates and assorted artifacts). I believe, contrary to what AMD says, those are issues specific to AMD, not Dell. Any Ryzen U based device from any OEM suffers the same lack of updated driver availability.But otherwise, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?As such, I can\'t fault Dell too much. The choices for Team Red are few and far between. The Inspiron 13 7375 is a perfectly adequate piece of hardware. Spec-wise, however, it is very much baseline. 8 GB RAM, 256 SSD, and 1080p IPS touch display are the same specifications that my now four-year-old windows tablet has. Speaking of storage, the Micron 1100 M.2 SATA SSD does not feel quite as snappy as a similarly spec\'d Samsung EVO 860 but it‚Äôs good enough.  Micron Storage Executive-- providing like functionality as Samsung Magician-- supports this drive and is a strongly recommended install.A lot of the included Dell software is very interesting, and, for the most part, helpful. I\'m particularly curious of Dell Mobile Connect. However, I recommend re-installing Windows from scratch, anyway, and use a standalone backup solution rather than rely on any of the OEM recovery partitions. One can certainly re-install any Dell specific software later.UPDATE 11/2018:Previously, I recommended waiting for the Lenovo Thinkpad A485 to be released before considering AMD Ryzen U based systems. My hypothesis Lenovo was holding off releasing A series until AMD releases a better driver suite to OEMs turned out inconclusive. No significant updates for Ryzen U Vega have existed for almost a year (Still based on Radeon software version 17.7). As of 2018, Nov 23, AMD is blaming OEMs, but AMD won‚Äôt even provide reference drivers to general public nor allow Ryzen Master (Overdrive won‚Äôt work either)\n\n','neutral','subjective',0.771,1,'2020-07-31 01:08:19.265750'),(121,282,'AGQHEOPURRHIJKF4ELDUT65NYCBQ','Omer H.','the United States','November 11, 2018',4,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQHEOPURRHIJKF4ELDUT65NYCBQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  The Ryzen CPU and entire AMD chipset, SSD layout, and \"only 8gb\" of ram, make this infinitely faster than the same with an Intel chip.2-1 capability is sci fi like, perhaps mostly because i only buy a computer every 5-6 years.CONS:NO dedicated PGUP/PGDN/HOME/END buttons - i guess millennial like to scroooolllllll all the time.

This laptop is purchased primarily for my Kid\'s online classes during this pandemic.  It does come with everything needed such as a windows license, webcam, and built in speaker.The package is very light, inside there is just the laptop itself and adaptor, plus manuals.  The manual is very simple as there is not much to the laptop.  The webcam on the top has a slider so you can close it when not in a meeting for privacy.  Although lacking num-keys, numbers can be accessed by pressing FN+Numb.  The sound is not the best but it is clear and loud enough for online meetings. I have walked around the house with this laptop and the wifi connection remained stable while windows is downloading update.Setting up windows is painless, clicking through few steps and within 10 minutes you are in windows desktop.  What surprises me is the speed, since built in memory is 64GB and not magnetic, it is reasonably fast at loading windows/app.  Another thing to note is this is vanilla windows they installed, there is absolutely no bloatware like you would get from other brand laptop.  Tested both Edge and Chrome browser for meeting, everything runs like it should out of the box.TL;DL, this is a budget laptop for light browsing, watching videos, and online meetings.  It is lower end spec but functions perfectly smooth.Update : Having accidentally enabled the numb on touchpad and could not reproduce it, I contacted the tech support of Winnovo, they are more than helpful.

However, they use it 6-8 hours a day, public transit commute with it, travel with it, and use it at home, so heavy use in that sense. We were hoping that since their requirements were minimal a cheaper laptop would work.Unfortunately, out of the box the thing chugged. Internet explorer had trouble starting. A partially closed screen put the laptop into black screen limbo where it was on but the screen wouldn\'t come back,  forcing a hard restart. It was light, and it ran, but it became clear that every little thing was going to be slow and take a fight. For a machine that was going to used 8 hours a day it wasn\'t going to work.  We returned it and got a cheap surface book instead.Now, that said this is a specific use case. The laptop works (maybe not as well as advertised, certainly not as well as some of the glowing reviews indicated) and it\'s $200.

While this ended up not being the model that fit my lifestyle, they took my product feedback and replied diligently across days.  They also managed to sell me up to the next-higher model, the LapBook Pro, which I have been absolutely thrilled with.A surprisingly impressive 1080P screen, a tiny form factor and solid metal construction make this a great carry-on laptop. The HeroBook Pro doesn\'t have a lot of horsepower and that\'s actually literally why I sought it out. I was looking for low-watt Intel thin\'n\'lights that have power-sipping CPU\'s and not a giant charging brick for a tiny travel bag, without forfeiting screen resolution. The $250 price tag make Chuwi\'s lineup attractive, and the qualtiy metal construction made it a good value, I feel.I would suggest, if you can, looking at the next-up model (the LapBook Pro) for juuuuuust the right amount of power for on-the-go, even for streaming intense 3D games from Steam Link or GeForce Now.But, if you just want to watch downloaded videos or catch up on email, the HeroBook Pro will accomplish all the fundamental tasks.

I haven\'t weighed to compare, but it\'s comparable to my older ipad in its case.  I wouldn\'t recommend this for a machine that you\'re going to be carrying around and opening and working with it in a variety of conditions.  Definitely not milspec grade.4,  I selected this laptop with some firm criteria: cost, 8GB, & SSD.  When I found this, I ran it past my husband who\'s stronger technically than I am.  He looked over the description, read the reviews, and conditionally approved it.  His concerns were that it wasn\'t that fast of a processor, but as I\'m mainly using this for browsing web sites and keeping track of my email, that\'s not a big issue as not a lot of cpu processing is called for.  The fact that it doesn\'t have a fan is a big plus as its quieter and one less mechanical part that could break.  I wish they made one w/a larger screen but the pricing is amazing.  And it is a higher-resolution screen.5. Out of the box, I turned the laptop over to my husband for him to get the initial setup completed.  He got it up and running on our house network, installed security sw and handed it back.  He commented that it was a pretty good little laptop and especially good at the price.  (It\'s quite convenient when you\'re married to your IT guy.)6. So one little (literally) issue has come up.  This afternoon when I went to use the laptop, I noticed the battery power had dropped quite a bit.  Checked the connection to the cpu and outlet. All good but still running down.  Got my husband involved later this afternoon.  He went and got some meter and there was a question about if the problem was the power source or the port it plugs into.  Much fiddling around.  That\'s when we discovered that we had the power plugged into the headphone jack.Okay fine.  Most  cpus have a different-sized jack, probably for that reason.  Once we got that sorted out, it went back to charging.  With the laptop open and facing you so that you can view the screen, it plugs in on the left.  Oh, and the battery icon shows a wee tiny plug next to the battery.  I told my husband/IT guy that he lost some cred on this issue.I may come back and add more comments as I continue to use this laptop.  My original reaction is that this is a fairly fragile laptop.  I wouldn\'t recommend it for people who want to haul it around to meetings or buy one for people/kids who want to use it for gaming or while working on the bus or at the beach.  On the other hand, it\'s a darn good cpu for the price.I am a happyish camper.So, still\n\n','positive','subjective',0.475,1,'2020-07-31 12:35:53.636165'),(142,332,'AEPUGOZNSHQONCBDK26F2AN2CMDA','Musical_Llama','the United States','April 25, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPUGOZNSHQONCBDK26F2AN2CMDA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  This thing is a heck of a deal for what you get.  8G RAM, a decent sized SSD, IPS FHD screen.

This little book is perfect in almost every way.In general, this Chromebook is perfect for what I bought it for: work-related tasks on the web, surfing the web, using Google Docs to type up documents & write lyrics for songs, and organizing thoughts and ideas into productivity apps and jotting down tasks in my Microsoft To-Do list app.  This Chromebook is lightning fast in powering up, connecting to WiFi & Bluetooth, and opening apps & browsers.The Screen size is non-jeopardizing; large enough for a functional workspace, but small enough to easily store away in a backpack. Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you\'re trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It\'s quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It\'s back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you\'re used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don\'t have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn\'t been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn\'t completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.\n\n','neutral','subjective',0.56,1,'2020-07-31 12:37:33.794821'),(146,348,'AEJQO2DEVMECTIHN7YL473KEWIDA','Shige-san','the United States','June 2, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJQO2DEVMECTIHN7YL473KEWIDA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14\" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3\" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We\'ll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I\'m still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it\'s not that difficult.  It\'s no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of usÔºöÔºâ\n\n','negative','subjective',0.595,1,'2020-07-31 12:37:33.801799'),(147,348,'AGCVJS3O73FAHCXHUD2XKZIS2EHA','Dean','the United States','June 4, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCVJS3O73FAHCXHUD2XKZIS2EHA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  I have used Chromebooks from day one.

My desktop at home has Windows 10 on it but I haven\'t turned it on yet since this Chromebook arrived last week since I wanted to give the Acer a fair chance and see how much I really miss Windows 10. So far, there hasn\'t been anything that has made me wish I was using Windows 10! The only times where I have felt a little bit inconvenienced is when I need to use Microsoft Office products. I say that I was only slightly inconvenienced because I am still able to use all of the Office programs (in multiple ways actually, now that there is Google Play Store support), they are just a different layout than I am used to and may not have some of the more extensive features that the Windows version has. For the vast majority of users, however, there will be a small adjustment period and then it\'ll be fine after that.To give you an idea of how much I use my laptop, I am a medical student and was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to use the programs that I needed for school (Uworld questions, Anki flashcards, etc) but this is where the Google Play Store really comes in handy. As an android phone user, I am very familiar with the Google Play Store and was happy to see that I could download most of the apps I have on my phone and most of them sync seamlessly (like lecture notes using Squid and the other apps that I mentioned earlier). Having the ability to use it as a tablet with the stylus and palm rejection makes taking notes in lecture significantly easier and they immediately sync to my phone so I can study anywhere. Also, the 3:2 aspect ratio makes using PDF textbooks way easier to read compared to most laptops. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and impressed with how far ChromeOS has come in such a short period of time. Highly recommend!!Pros:+ Light OS makes boot times <5 seconds and efficient use of space, as well as great battery life.+ Screen looks great and gets plenty bright, I usually don\'t go higher than 70%.+ Keyboard is easy to type on and comfortable, also has a backlight which comes in handy.+ Aluminum chassis makes it feel as high quality as it performs, similar look/feel to a MacBook Pro.+ The touchpad is smooth and very easy to use, especially with the added gestures unique to ChromeOS.+ Google Play Store adds a ton of uses/features and allows you to sync apps from your phone easily.+ The foldable touchscreen expands its usability for personal, school, or gaming use.+ Love being able to play my mobile games on the larger display.+ Note taking with the stylus is great, there are plenty of apps in the store to try and it is made by Wacom so it has  great pressure sensitivity and palm rejection.Cons:- ChromeOS takes some getting used to when switching from Windows.- The keyboard also has an adjustment period since it has some variations from the classic Windows keyboard, such as:  ~ Caps Lock is replaced with a search key that searches google in a tab (and also your computer for apps, files, etc).  ~ There is no delete key, use Alt + Backspace instead. It was replaced by a lock key to instantly lock the laptop.  ~ The top row of function keys are replaced with browser keys like forward, back, refresh, task switcher (equivalent  to Windows + Tab on the windows keyboards), etc.  ~ Task manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc on windows) is now accessible using Search + Esc.- A lot of functionality needs an internet connection so it is somewhat limited when there isn\'t wifi. I use the hotspot  on my phone for when I am in a place without Wifi and it works fine so not much of an issue overall.- There is the occasional issue when trying to use apps from Linux or Google Play Store that aren\'t yet optimized for  Chromebooks that can cause the app to crash.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.443,1,'2020-07-31 12:48:51.524658'),(159,151,'AHQBTRV5CQ4MOOQDE6RAMG2UBX7Q','KaliS-Pugilist','the United States','November 30, 2018',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQBTRV5CQ4MOOQDE6RAMG2UBX7Q','\n\n  I actually purchased the Pixelbook during Black Friday and thought I got great deal.  Then Cyber Monday came and Spin 13 was on sale for the same price ($699), so I bought one thinking I\'ll check it out and decide on either it of the Pixelbook.  Well, I did my comparison and I really dig the Acer.  The Pixelbook is high-quality construction no doubt, slimmer, a little lighter, and \"prettier\".  The Spin 13 is a TANK...it feels solid in the hands and doesn\'t make you feel like your holding a piece of delicate jewelry, like with the Pixelbook.  I am sending my Pixelbook back to Bestbuy and staying with the Spin 13.  The only thing the Pixelbook seems to have better than it is size and the display can get brighter.  But to be honest the brightness of the display didn\'t really matter because I never rock out with the display on the highest setting anyway.  So at a normal setting for me, about 50%, the screen is just fine.  Putting on max brightness is too much on either laptop.  Also, yes the Pixelbook is lighter.  But it\'s not that much lighter surprisingly.  I was thinking it would really be much lighter and it\'s really not that big of a trade off.  I really hope that Dbrand comes out with some skins for it, that will set the Spin 13 over the top.\n\n','positive','subjective',0.908,1,'2020-07-31 12:48:51.531888'),(160,151,'AHBVC6N645JLF3J64UQA4JV725EQ','blfsmomanddad','the United States','December 3, 2018',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBVC6N645JLF3J64UQA4JV725EQ','\n\n  While I can\'t say how good of a purchase this is at the full price, I bought this while it was on sale for $700 and I could not recommend this Chromebook more.Pros:-Powerful i5-8250U with 8GB of RAM leading to a zero slowdown experience-3:2 aspect ratio giving tons of screen space-Android App and Linux (Crostini) support so you can run practically any application you want-2 in 1 with a pen built in.Cons:-When doing intensive things such as Linux gaming, the fan becomes very loud very quickly and will jump around between different speeds.In-detail explanation:This laptop features an i5-8250U, a processor with 4 cores/8 threads, with maximum turbo boost to 3.4GHz. This gives the laptop metric tons of processing power, and leads to an experience where slowdowns simply do not occur. It uses a screen with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Although some may find this bad as it departs from the standard 16:9 aspect ratio, I personally prefer it as it gives additional screen space. It has Android App support and Linux program support so you can write code or run full Linux desktop applications while also using apps from the giant collection of apps in the Play Store. It also comes with a pen that\'s built in to the bottom right of the laptop and it\'s a 2 in 1 so you can use the laptop as both a laptop and a tablet. However, under intense gaming conditions, the laptop fans become very loud and change volumes rapidly. It also weighs on the heavier side however I wouldn\'t consider that a major downside.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.44,1,'2020-07-31 12:48:51.537205'),(161,151,'AGNZZYYYW6AMURAVMJDNVMUVGPVQ','L.

I previously had an HP Chromebook 14 and wanted another Chromebook. The screen is really nice, but has pretty big bezels (this empty space is similarly noticeable above the keyboard). Overall, just a bit bigger/heavier than you\'d expect a 13.5in laptop to be. Speakers sound pretty good, but they are on the bottom so they get distorted sometimes. Battery is pretty good so far. Performance is quick, but the fan on the bottom can get kinda noisy sometimes when doing something that isn\'t just basic browsing. I was playing a game (Helix Jump) and it at times was laggy, but performance was largely solid. Keyboard is good, but the weird bright spots when the backlit keyboard lights are on are definitely noticeable---though I don\'t really mind them. Stylus is kinda neat, however can ONLY be removed from a specific angle (tablet mode-ish) so be careful when trying to remove it. The lip to actually lift the screen off of the keyboard is extremely small and definitely tricky at times to open. Hope this provides a more informed purchase.\n\n','positive','subjective',0.507,1,'2020-07-31 12:48:51.541842');
