You will get distortion looking straight on. The monitor was poorly calibrated with WAY too much gamma, luckily adjusting this with Windows is trivial, I will get back to \'S Mode\' later on. You will not be able to use this monitor for watching movies with a lot of dark scenes. If you are looking at the screen dead on the outer regions of black will be distorted to LIGHT grey.The keyboard is decent, the 10-key is a bit difficult with the keys not being the right size on the side. The button press is tactile and usable and the feel is fine enough for typing blind, which you shouldn\'t have to do since the keyboard is back-lit.The touch pad is okay, it\'s actually a bit too sensitive, the lower corners can be used as buttons but I would greatly prefer physical buttons like on the current Lenovo brand laptops. The touch pad has a fingerprint reader in the top right corner which interferes with the operation of the touch pad but at least the fingerprint reader is fast!The speakers are complete garbage, they have no semblance to actual sounds and it sounds like you are listening to a cellphone speaker through a wooden door. They are completely unusable for anything at all, do not buy this laptop if you enjoy playing anything on your speakers.The webcam is usable, but it\'s nothing to write home about, capping out at 720p/30fps it will feel like a power-point presentation more than a video feed on any video chat. The sound is about the same as phone quality. If you do video chats frequently, find another laptop.Back to windows and \'S Mode\'. Windows is pre-installed, it had some of the latest updates already so it was recently installed. It doesn\'t have much bloatware, but having Skype installed is too much already. The \"type\" of Windows that is installed is called \'S Mode\' which is basically a locked down completely restrictive version of Windows. You can\'t even download Chrome from the web you have to get it from the Microsoft store - Chrome being the first app I install on any Windows computer -. I removed \'S Mode\' almost immediately.The laptop has 4Gb of non-removable memory and 4Gb of replaceable memory which is nice even though it\'s only single channel.The laptop is made from a plastic frame which I actually don\'t mind, it makes the laptop reasonably light, but it gives it a cheap experience. Opening the lid for example requires two hands or a technique, both of which is actually mildly inconvenient.Summary:The good: Decent keyboard and touch pad, fast loading web pagesIf you like a want a PC for viewing Netflix/media at home with no headphones, look somewhere else. If you want a PC for viewing Wikipedia/news then this will be decent but there are cheaper laptops that can do that better. If you have a fancy IPS monitor, you will hate this laptop. If you are even thinking about gaming, the answer is no.Seeing as this laptop has such limited uses with the horrible screen and speakers, I cannot give this laptop a better review that 3 stars. It\'s only purpose is to view webpages and basic coffee-shop work.\n\n','negative','subjective',1,1,'2020-07-30 19:24:48.977738'),(2,1,'AFVVQZGK5NXTY6MEBQVG6WEDVNCQ','Javier Contreras','the United States','February 20, 2020',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVVQZGK5NXTY6MEBQVG6WEDVNCQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  With respect to the aspect everything is perfect for the cost, the only problem is that I wanted to check the memory and it turns out that it came with a 4GB and the description says of 8GB I am disappointed in this.  since one trusts what they are selling.

My criteria were: lightweight, 8gb RAM, 64gb+ SSD, 1080p, with a full-sized HDMI port (no mini), Windows OS. I wanted it mostly for web browsing, word processing, and some fairly light gaming (modded Minecraft, Java version). After about a month, I am so far satisfied with this computer for all of those tasks.In fact, it surpassed my expectations in regards to gaming. I expected that it would be incapable of running more than a couple of mods, but so far it\'s taken everything I\'ve thrown at it. I have not overclocked the processor (intentionally, anyway - perhaps windows does it automatically now?), and as such am operating at the stock 2.3Ghz (I think).I was slightly worried about purchasing this due to the reviews that commented about the screen quality/viewing angles. However, I am happy to report that I have not had any issues with screen visibility or warped edges. Perhaps I am simply plebian in my tastes, but it looks fine to me.It came with Windows 10 S, which I certainly did not want, but it was perfectly easy to disable.The backlit keyboard is honestly a lifesaver. I hadn\'t specifically sought out this feature, but it\'s fantastic. It comes with various brightnesses instead of a toggle, which frankly is unnecessary because the lowest setting is plenty bright. However, as mentioned in other reviews, it does cause a significant hit to battery life (or so it seems).The battery life is my only quibble, but admittedly, I believe that\'s mostly due to my usage rather than the machine itself. I have multiple Chrome tabs running at all times, as well as Visual Studio Code, and frequently Minecraft as well. At this level of usage, the battery lasts on average 2-3 hours. I haven\'t timed it though, so that is simply an estimate on my part.All in all, I am much happier with this $300 laptop than I was with my old laptop, which 8 years ago was twice the price. No doubt you can find better performance with a higher budget, but if you are tight on money, I highly recommend this device.\n\n','neutral','subjective',0.358,1,'2020-07-30 19:24:49.004766'),(6,1,'AFES4QMHC2XWW4S7KPVLBQ7GVRBA','Electric imaging equipment designer.','the United States','June 18, 2020',2,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFES4QMHC2XWW4S7KPVLBQ7GVRBA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n   I was angry of seeing this kind of fake like screen.

I fell in love with it.  When the project ended, I had to turn it back in to the company.  So went to Amazon and found my baby.  I brought it.With the SSD drive, it boots up like an iPad.  For all these years I would complain about Windows being slow.  But now see it was the hardware.  Next, it is so light.  I love just carrying it from my desk to a meeting to take notes or minutes.Light weight and super fast and thin.  I only got the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB drive. Would have liked the 16 GB RAM and bigger drive but wanted to keep the price down. you can go crazy with add ons. After all I have 5 other PC\'s at home already (3 Apple & 2 Windows).Now for the semi bad part. I got the LG Gram laptop all set up with Office, Outlook, OneDrive, my special software loaded etc.. and noticed some web pages were slow to down load.  Checked my speed and it was bad.  I got .6 mbps download and 12 mbps upload.  Yes, that is correct the download was poor. barely moving.  I checked all drivers were up to date. I rebooted my modem, router, changed networks, compared with my other PC\'s and they all were fine.  175 to 280 mpbs download.  All signs to me was the hardware was defective.  I had only had the new laptop for 2 days. I was ready to return it. !!!A friend came over, I complained to him. He suggested it was a driver problem.  I showed him all drivers were up to date. Then he noticed the wifi adapter was made by Intel (wifi 9560) BUT the driver was from Microsoft.  He said lets see if Intel has a driver.  Sure enough they did. we installed it and the problem was fixed.Wow, I was so relieved.  I really did not want to send it back. I loved it.

So, I can compare this with Acer.Pros:1. Battery life: Around 10 hours of keeping play videos like watching movies or intensive work. Normal document work on and off can last  around 17 hours. Idling with display on may last for 28 hours. (new update: keep working on MS office and it lasts around 10 hours.)2. Super light weight and big screen of course. ( I also got a rechargeable blue tooth mouse to save a USB port.)3. Micro SD card slot: I love it. Acer swift 5 uses SD card with half of the card exposed outside, making it easy to bend. This LG used micro SD and most of the card in the laptop. I now used 512GB micro SD card as the drive. I can bring the card away with me for the important data.4. Read/Write speed up to 87 MB/s for big file transfer among SSD, micro SD, and USB3.0 card reader. The card reader was tested around 100MB/s on Acer swift 5.5. easy to setup with rechargeable bluetooth mouse.6. support up to 2TB micro SD card for future expansion.7. 3x USB3.0 + 1x type C USB3.0 are powerful enough to drive those WD and Seagate derive at the same time. I am not sure about USB3.1. However, I have 4 of them connected and only transferring data with 2 HDD drives.Cons:1. Response a little bit slower than Acer swift 5. But still can take it. (I turned down real-time security things. Anyway, I usually behind a gateway firewall)2. Audio effect is not good without earphone, much worse than Acer swift 5. High pitch sounds like locked inside the computer. This is basically not for entertainment. Earphone or external speakers are recommended. The win 10 even has no equalizer for me to fix sound effects.3. A little bit glare of video playback, not top quality, worst than Acer swift 5.4. If fan is triggered on, it generates more heat and it seems getting into dead loop of keep cooling down. It ends up with making it shorter battery time. Dimming the screen is a better option so that the PC stay longer for 1 full charge and avoiding fan triggered.Conclusion: This is very good for business travel and documentation work, not recommended for gaming or entertainment.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.58,1,'2020-07-30 19:24:52.424687'),(9,2,'AFIVDM4APKFE4Z3EMPZY2CNTEO7A','A.J.','the United States','October 8, 2019',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIVDM4APKFE4Z3EMPZY2CNTEO7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Edit edit - Screen in the last 2 weeks has developed excessive play, to where simply typing or using the track pad causes the screen to annoyingly wobble back and forth.

I originally was considering more expensive options, but I had tried his Chromebook for a couple hours (writing a paper using it) and I liked it too. I ordered a new one, and upon receiving it I plugged it into the charger for its first charge. The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement.The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen. I ended up returning this one as well and choosing a more expensive laptop from a different company as I planned originally. My friend\'s Acer Chromebook R11 works fine and he has had it about 6 months. He was surprised that I had these troubles.I\'m not sure what the quality control process is.

(Most developers are.) For years I ran Windows with a Linux VM or Linux with a Windows VM, and was able to have both worlds I wanted/needed - though with more than a little effort to bridge the VM host and guest environments. Then Apple moved Mac OS to Darwin, which provides a full Unix underneath - heaven. But expensive, and with Apples built-in limits - few ports, no touchscreens, and increasingly not expansible. Then Chromebooks offer Linux within a simple, fairly elegant UI environment. And then - crucial, for me - Microsoft offers WSL 2, with Linux integration for developers.

So we developers (who are also consumers) get the benefits of commodity competition - like this terrific LG model.It has everything except good speakers.The most compelling thing for me is probably the 14\" screen on a 2.5 lb device. Add that it\'s a touchscreen (which is something I use a lot) and convertible (which turns out to be crucially useful occasionally), and it\'s an amazing machine. On top of that, the expansibility - there\'s an addition PCIe / NVME disk slot, extensible RAM, even an SD slot - and lots of ports, and I can\'t imagine a better choice for a high-capability yet also lightweight device.In the month I\'ve had it, it has lived up to my (high) expectations. Windows still has a lot of ragged edges (but you can tweak it to do whatever you need), and the speakers are tinny, at best. But everything basically works really well, and It is as or more capable than most laptops, including being more portable and versatile at the same time.

Do not use the answer from the representative as correct on this one. I even asked a more clarifying question and was told there is a USB-C, but you cannot charge over it.The screen is a 1920x1080 TN panel, no touch screen256GB NVME drive - no spinning HDD, so disregard the section that says 7200rpm on the description page8gb of DDR4 ram at 2400mhz3 cell battery - seems okay power saving options gives it roughly 8hrs depending on what you\'re doing and your tolerable screen brightness (but your mileage may vary)There is no back lit keyboard. The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it.Review:This appears to be Lenovo\'s answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU.Compared to my wife\'s Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that\'s not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the \"New\" model and $699 for a used model.Conclusion:If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you\'re getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait.If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it\'s suppose to come in at a similar price point.

I got my laptop a few days ago and used it for one day before having the touchpad give up on me (no my rating on this product will not be affected because i received a defect), I followed the steps on their website to fix this to no avail because they didn’t have the proper hardware updates on their site for this laptop as you can see in their description of the product on the amazon listing page some of the info is wrong. That being said this laptop is pretty decent and I do recommend it for college students and business workers it’s light and very portable, I can hold this with one hand effortlessly the only thing i dislike about the build is the plastic shell, but when you get specs like the AMD RYZEN 5 3500u with Vega 8 graphics and a 256 gb SSD for this price you cant really complain.More about gaming: I’ve tested games like Warface, Fortnite, and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 they played well on low settings this pc isn’t bad for that what it wont run that well will be games like call of duty modern warfare, but i’m sure with overclocking and enabling parked cores even that can be played. The screen of the laptop is 60hz so playing these games at 60fps looks smooth.Tips: If you plan on buying this laptop and you aren’t used to 14 inch screens beware it’s pretty hard to get used to but you will eventually.Summary: This is a good laptop for work and school it’s pretty powerful and it’s also good for light gaming I recommend it.Note to Lenovo: Support this product give it touchpad driver updates or Im afraid more people will run into the same problem as me and have to return the product because you aren’t supporting it well enough, I can barely find info or videos on this model at all, but I may consider making one if I do decide to get this model again after I return the defect I received.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.773,1,'2020-07-30 19:25:59.486277'),(27,19,'AHGNICASCCFT6K5VGZ2AYH6OMAQQ','Milton','the United States','May 13, 2020',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGNICASCCFT6K5VGZ2AYH6OMAQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  It\'s great and it\'s very reliable it charges so fast!and its amazing!\n\n','positive','subjective',1,1,'2020-07-30 19:25:59.493116'),(28,21,'AFTKVTVVRCUUY7ASSH4ULTBGY4ZQ','Dave and Kym','the United States','July 13, 2019',5,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTKVTVVRCUUY7ASSH4ULTBGY4ZQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  Bought this unit as a budget replacement for my fairly high-powered Dell desktop which was lost during flooding. I wasn\'t expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected.Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box.I wasn\'t paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs.Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer.Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that\'s just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it.Pretty sure I\'m going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won\'t do complex graphics.Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I\'ve read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life.Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon.The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don\'t even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions.A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that \"it gets so hot\" or \"the fan sounds like a 747 taking off\": Just because it\'s called a laptop doesn\'t mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable.If it died tomorrow, I\'d buy another.Loving itUpdate 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close):\"Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!\"Did you hear that? I\'m a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I\'ll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I\'m OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer.Totally pleased.\n\n','negative','subjective',0.822,1,'2020-07-30 19:26:11.666057'),(29,21,'AGFUKNF6EAA5277QYX6ETYYTDNLA','ttview','the United States','June 28, 2019',1,'/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFUKNF6EAA5277QYX6ETYYTDNLA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8','\n\n  The fan noise on this laptop is so bad that when you first hear it you\'re going to think your next door neighboor is using a leaf blower outside. I DARE you to tell me i\'m wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There\'s more: If you\'re a long time user of acer products you\'ve become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here\'s the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you\'re used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you\'ll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you\'re only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the \"acer quick access application\" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won\'t solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port.Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can\'t even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I\'ll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you\'re a long time acer product user and you\'ve become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality.
